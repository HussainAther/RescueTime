# What is this?
This repository is a collection of data about my productivity tracked by RescueTime. 

The levels of productivity for each day are stored in productivity_day. Each .csv file has a column "Productivity" with a productivity level:

+ 2 - very productive
+ 1 - productive
+ 0 - neutral
+ -1 - distracting
+ -2 - very distracting 

The seconds spent on each productivity level are shown.
