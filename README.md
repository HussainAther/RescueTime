# What is this?
This repository is a collection of data about my productivity tracked by RescueTime. 

The levels of productivity for each weekday between the hours of 6 am and 8 pm are stored in productivity_day. Each .csv file has a column "Productivity" with a productivity level:

+ 2 : very productive
+ 1 : productive
+ 0 : neutral
+ -1 : distracting
+ -2 : very distracting 

The seconds spent on each productivity level are shown. These data give a good representation of daily productivity by sharing how I spend my workdays.
